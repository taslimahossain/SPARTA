### I am an all time learner, enthusiastic about way too many things but especially gaining new skills and continuosly expanding knowledge.

#### I recently discovered a passion for tech, and started this exciting journey by attending a Bootcamp course covering the fundamentals of Web and Software development. What I enjoy about it, it's the creative aspect combined to the use and practice of analytical and problem solving skills.
